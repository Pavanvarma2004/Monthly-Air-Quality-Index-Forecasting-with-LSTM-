Accurate prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI) is essential for public health, enabling 
authorities to implement timely measures to reduce pollution exposure. This study leverages Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast monthly AQI, given their effectiveness 
in handling time-series data with complex temporal dependencies. The model is trained on 
historical AQI data, along with associated meteorological parameters such as PM2.5, NOâ‚‚, 
temperature, and humidity. Pre-processing steps, including data normalization and feature 
engineering, are applied to enhance prediction accuracy. 
The LSTM model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively 
captures seasonal patterns and long-term trends, significantly outperforming traditional methods 
like ARIMA. This research indicates that LSTM-based forecasting can provide reliable early 
warnings, facilitating proactive air quality management. Future improvements could include 
integrating real-time data streams and exploring advanced architectures for increased accuracy.
